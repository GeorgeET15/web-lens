# Language Simplification Update (Features & Homepage)

## Changes Made (2026-01-13)

### 1. Highlighted "Drag-and-Drop" Feature
As requested, explicitly mentioned the block-based visual editor.

**Homepage (`Index.tsx`)**
- Added **"Drag-and-Drop Builder"** to the feature grid.
- Description: "Build tests visually by placing logic blocks. No coding required—just drag, drop, and connect."
- Updated grid from 3 to 4 items.

**Features Page (`Features.tsx`)**
- Renamed "Block Orchestration" → **"Visual Drag-and-Drop Editor"**.
- Description: "Build tests by dragging and connecting blocks. Simple, visual, and powerful."

### 2. Simplified Features Page Language
Replaced technical jargon with clear, user-centric terms.

| Technical Term | Simplified Term |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Feature_Specification** | **Features** |
| **Professional Constraints** | **Professional Reliability** |
| **ENGINE_CORE** | **Core Engine** |
| **FLOW_LOGIC** | **Test Builder** |
| **OBSERVABILITY** | **Debug Tools** |
| **Semantic Identification** | **Smart Element Finding** |
| **Deterministic Runtime** | **Reliable Execution** |
| **Scenario Injection** | **Data-Driven Testing** |
| **TAF Feedback Loop** | **Failure Analysis** |
| **Live Trace Stream** | **Real-time Logs** |
| **SYSTEM_NON_NEGOTIABLES** | **Our Philosophy** |
| **NEXT_MODULE** / **SYSTEM_COMPARISON** | **Comparison** / **Compare Tools** |

All descriptions were also rewritten to be inviting and easy to understand, avoiding intimidated terms like "polled verification loop" or "immutable logic blocks".

## Impact
The website now clearly communicates the **No-Code** and **Drag-and-Drop** value proposition while maintaining the professional, high-tech aesthetic.
